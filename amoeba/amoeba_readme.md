AMOEBA 2048AES SDK
Overview
The AMOEBA 2048AES SDK is a quantum-enhanced, MCP-compliant development kit for building distributed applications on the AMOEBA 2048 operating system. It leverages a quadralinear computation model with 4x CHIMERA heads (Compute, Quantum, Security, Orchestration) to provide a unified interface for classical and quantum resources.
Features

Quantum-Native Microkernel: Dual-layer kernel for classical and quantum resource management.
Quadralinear Computation: Superposition-based task execution across CHIMERA heads.
Quantum-Safe Security: Cryptographic protections for distributed workflows.
MCP/MAML Integration: Standardized communication with executable MAML documents.
Formal Verification: Ortac-based runtime checks for high-assurance workflows.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM
16GB+ System RAM
Ubuntu 20.04+ or compatible Linux distribution
Docker and NVIDIA Container Toolkit
Python 3.8+, Qiskit, PyTorch, Pydantic
OCaml and Ortac for verification

Installation

Run the setup script:bash setup.sh


Verify installation:python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
python3 -c "import qiskit; print(qiskit.__version__)"



Usage

Create a new project:mkdir my_amoeba_project
cd my_amoeba_project
cp ../amoeba2048_project/* .


Run a sample workflow:python3 amoeba_2048_sdk.py


Create and execute a MAML workflow:
Edit amoeba_maml_template.maml.md with your task details.
Submit to an MCP gateway:python3 -m amoeba_2048_sdk --maml amoeba_maml_template.maml.md





Project Structure

amoeba_2048_sdk.py: Core SDK implementation.
amoeba_maml_template.maml.md: Template for MAML workflows.
chimera_spec.mli: Gospel specification for CHIMERA head verification.
setup.sh: Environment setup script.
README.md: This file.

Next Steps

Explore the MAML template to create custom workflows.
Integrate with Project Dunes for distributed execution.
Use Ortac to add formal verification to your workflows.
