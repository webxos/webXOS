# Privacy Policy for webXOS Software 

**Effective Date: November 14, 2025**

edTV and related techonology (webxos.netlify.app/mirror webcam use and related tech etc) is a free open sourced experimental browser-based augmented reality (AR) tool developed as part of the webXOS software project in this repo. It is provided for **testing purposes and non-commercial research only**, hosted at [webxos.netlify.app/edTV](https://webxos.netlify.app/edTV.html + webxos.netlify.app/anything etc) and available under the open-source [MIT License] on GitHub at [github.com/webxos](https://github.com/webxos). 

**This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the App. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency.**

*By using the App, you acknowledge that it is a prototype tool intended for educational, testing, and research exploration of AR face-tracking technologies (e.g., mesh synchronization via webcam). It is not a production service and should not be used for sensitive or real-world applications.*

## 1. No Information Collected:

The App is designed to operate **entirely locally** in your web browser, with no server-side data storage or transmission. 

We do **not collect, store, or share any personal data** from users.

- **No Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**: We do not request, collect, or process names, emails, IP addresses, device IDs, or any other identifiers.
- 
- **Camera and Media Access**: The App may request permission to access your device's webcam for real-time AR face scanning (e.g., overlaying meshes on detected facial features). For Testing Purposes locally.

# This access is:

  - Processed locally using browser APIs (e.g., WebGL, MediaStream).
  - Not recorded, saved, or uploaded anywhere.
  - Limited to the duration of your session; data is discarded immediately upon closing the tab or denying/revoking permissions.
    
**Usage Data**: No analytics, logs, or telemetry are collected. Any "live" indicators (e.g., facing angle) are computed on-device and not retained.
**No Cookies or Tracking**: The App does not use cookies, local storage for tracking, or third-party scripts.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

*Since no data is collected:*

- There is **no use** of your information for advertising, profiling, or any other purpose.
- For research and testing: Developers and contributors (under the MIT License) may access anonymized, aggregated feedback if voluntarily provided via GitHub issues or the developer's X account (@webxos). No raw video or images are requested.

**The App's purpose is to demonstrate AR capabilities for browser-based research, such as mesh synchronization and facial landmark detection, without compromising user privacy.**

## 3. Sharing Your Information

Use our software at your own risk. We do **not share, sell, or disclose** any data because none is collected. The MIT License allows forking and modification of the source code, but users/contributors are expected to uphold similar privacy standards in derivatives.

## 4. Data Security

- All processing occurs in your browser, reducing risks from server breaches.
- We recommend using HTTPS-enabled browsers and revoking camera permissions after use.
- As an open-source project, the code is publicly auditable on GitHub—review it for peace of mind. (github.com/webxos)


## 5. *Changes to This Policy*

*We may update this policy to reflect changes in the App (e.g., new features). Check the GitHub repo for the latest version. Continued use after updates implies acceptance.*
