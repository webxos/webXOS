Agent Console Components
Front-End only page and boilerplate template.
Grid (10x10 Dots): Visual QNN layer. Click dots to toggle activation (green/red/blue colors). Hover for coords (X:Y).
Console Log: Scrollable chat showing user inputs, bot responses, and events (e.g., training starts).
Controls:

PLAY/STOP: Toggle 24/7 training mode per agent (green/red glow).
execute: Submit input from text field to train (updates stats/grid).
prompt: Open modal to inject custom prompts (e.g., "Optimize for speed").
api: Open modal with backend setup steps (detailed below).
X: Reset agent to initial state.
Upload/Export: Import JSON model; export stats/messages as agent_X_model.json.


Stats Panel:

Wins/Losses/Draws: Simulated game outcomes.
Score %: Win rate based on moves.
Moves Made: Input executions.
Avg. Think Time: Cumulative seconds.
Training Data: KB of prompts/inputs.
Vector Angle: Global adjustment (0-360° via slider).



Global Controls (Bottom Bar)

RUN ALL: Starts training on all agents.
STOP ALL: Pauses all.
RESET ALL: Reloads page.
HELP: Opens this manual modal.
Chromatic Slider + Knob: Drag 0-100 to set vector angle (color shifts red→violet). Affects all agents' simulations.

Tips

Connect Back-End to use in real-time.
Training simulates QNN via random grid flips/stats increments—no real ML backend by default.
Export models for sharing; import to resume sessions.
Grid interactions influence "neural" state visually.

Backend Integration (API Connect)
TRIOS supports external APIs for real QNN training/data via fetch(). Use Netlify for serverless deployment. Steps from the in-app API modal:

Create GitHub Repo:

Go to github.com/new.
Name: trios-backend (e.g., Node.js/Express or Python/Flask).
Add sample endpoint: /train (POST: {input, agentId} → {response, stats}).


Deploy to Netlify:

Link GitHub to netlify.com → New site from Git.
Select repo; set build command (e.g., npm run build).
Deploy—get URL like your-site.netlify.app.
