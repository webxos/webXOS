# webXOS Development Guidelines

## Project Overview
webXOS is a web-based operating system interface built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

## Code Style
- Use modern ES6+ JavaScript features
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes)
- Include comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Optimize for performance and accessibility

## Architecture Principles
- Modular component design
- Event-driven architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Progressive enhancement
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Review Criteria
- Code must be compatible with modern browsers
- All UI changes should maintain the OS-like interface
- Performance impact should be minimal
- Security considerations for web-based OS functionality
- Accessibility standards compliance

## Specific Patterns
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow semantic HTML structure
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
```

      - name: Test changes
        uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            Test these changes for:
            1. Compatibility with Netlify deployment
            2. Build process integrity  
            3. Runtime functionality
            4. Performance impact on live site
```

## üîç Monitoring and Analytics

### Performance Analysis
```
@claude analyze the current bundle size and suggest optimizations for faster loading on webxos.netlify.app
```

### User Experience Improvements

```
@claude perform a security audit of the webXOS codebase, focusing on XSS and injection vulnerabilities
```

## üìà Productivity Tips

### 1. **Use Specific Commands**
Instead of: `@claude help`
Use: `@claude add error handling to the file manager's delete function`

### 2. **Provide Context**
```
@claude I'm working on the window manager (main/js/window-manager.js). 
The windows aren't properly resizing on mobile. Can you fix the responsive behavior?
```

### 3. **Iterative Improvements**
```
@claude review my previous implementation and suggest 3 specific improvements
```

### 4. **Code Quality Checks**
```
@claude check this component for potential memory leaks and performance issues
```
