## update and fix and make a final version of GALAXYCRAFT: RED VS BLUE
## 10v10 team deathmatch first person shooter, users must attack eachothers "CORES"

## 3 classes: first being the original scout class with scope and jetpack and scan abilities as is, 

## <the other 2 the medic and assault (new classes)> <they cannot use jetpack or scope or scan> , <just space bar auto click (default for all classes, 1 shot auto fire space bar, light damage to core, 1 shot all drones and players)>. <make sure games working with webxos 2025 copyright on main menu and user can seemless switch between 1 original class (scout with enhance jetpack from tower defense and neurot space bar)> and <the other 2 new classes as requested>. <give me a final working with all menu buttons tested and working and a simplified UI that streamlines all stats and data into one ESC button menu seemless keeping user cursor locked into the first person shooter game>, <both teams red and blue for seemless single player player where the drones work as intended auto balancing and unable to attack the core (only players/user can attack the core, add the multiplayer placeholders.>

the original game was: make the final version of galaxycraft: red vs blue, make sure all users have unlimited ammo for all guns no reload. users gun is left click scan, right click scope 4x, shift button jet pack with a nice jetpack optimized like unreal tournanament, space bar is autofire only with neurots from the players gun. make sure to prevent players from falling through the map. make sure to optimize for no less than 30 fps on mobile, for smooth game runtime. make sure all 3 classes are working (scan and right click scope for scout, shotgun left click and right click shield for assault, and left click honing missile, right click restore shield of a frield unit for medic, 3 units scout, assault, medic, thats all and the replacement drones working as needed. space bar is auto far for all 3 classes, left click is their special skill right click is their speical skill for all 3 classes, ) assault gets enhanced damage to the core with their left click shotgun but limited range, assault has fastest run speed, and a orb energy shield (like reinhardt from overwatch right click mouse to use their energy for extra shield, medic uses their rigth click to send a shield repair link to repair users shield so medic/assault can stack and the medic can heal the assault sheidl etc, and health, with right click so the medic acts as the support role, scout is a general sniper/jetpack lightweight role wit one gun, and the medic and assault have the same space bar auto far and extra left click shotgun, and purple neurot etc.) 

## <the yellow shotgun neurot and the right click purple homing neurot for the assault (shotgun)> are new and the medic (homing neurot class) use this to correct the game its the best version i have so far, add the 3 classes and changes as needed, 2 tower bases, make it so scouts and medics do light damage to core, <assault does enhanced core damage with shotgun left click mouse but must be close> <but one shot drones and other players>, <all players 1 shot eachother like airsoft/paintball rules with neurots>, <turn the gun functions into 3 new classes for this new game red vs blue use this to correct the game>

## <add the 3 classes and changes as needed>
## <2 tower bases>
## <make it so scouts and medics do light damage to core>
## <but one shot drones and other players>
## <all players 1 shot eachother like airsoft/paintball rules with neurots>
## <W A S D seemless controls (that play like unreal tournament)>
## <with a settings menu with sensitivity and invert W/S controls only>
## <make sure the game runs seemless 500 entity scene>
## <boxes in the middle, mars surface, stylized and randomized every map generation like a paintball coarse>
## users spawn behind their respective towers on a mirrored map 
 
## OUTPUT: <GALAXYCRAFT: RED VS BLUE by webxos 2025>, a fun lightweight <10v10 team game that uses drones spawns to balance missing teammates for discconnect or offline localdb play>. 

## future multiplayer $webxos integrations placeholders for now
## users earn $webxos as they play etc placeholders for now, 

##MAIN CHANGES NEEDED:
<3 classes> SCOUT, ASSAULT, MEDIC, see what we can do. 
## <a modern take on team deathmatch three js for browers> on <sci fi mars space setting> <emulating legacy games like starsiege tribes, team fortress2, and unreal tournmanet in a lightweight sandbox engine>, <a lightweight three js webgl based gpu engine that runs 30 fps seemless on low end devices, one click for mobile support for minimal play>

##<able to be made into other types of first person shooter games with insructive text embedded for dev teams to build with and mod this html file with, but finalized for full play and use.>
