**webXOS** is an innovative software development company developing progressive web applications tailored for decentralized local environments. Leveraging native JavaScript, WebGL, Three.js, and WebAssembly (WASM), Webxos delivers lightweight, modular progressive web apps (PWAs) that prioritize performance, privacy, and sustainability. Our ecosystem, showcased at [webxos.netlify.app](https://webxos.netlify.app) and [huggingface.co/webxos](https://huggingface.co/webxos), encompasses eco-friendly apps, retro games, and client-side AI agents, all designed to operate seamlessly in the browser.

Each webXOS modular APP (webxos.netlify.app/tools) is a self-contained `.html` file, embedding all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets for maximum portability and modularity. We harness web worker driven tools to create advanced prompts that accelerate the development of high-performance, decentralized apps. From P2P networking tools to immersive WebGL games, webXOS empowers developers to build the future. 

*WEBXOS is pioneering frameworks and tools on a browser first philosophy, emphasizing modularity, efficiency, and environmental responsibility.*

Building the underlying architecture for connected devices, focusing on stability, efficiency, and real-time data processing. Utilizing bespoke web worker models and strategic prompting to streamline development, automate complex tasks, and create intelligent, responsive software.

Developing applications that run natively in web browsers, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, easy deployment, and zero-installation user experiences. Tailoring software to run efficiently on low-power and applying sophisticated algorithms and computational logic to maximize processing power, ensuring minimal latency and maximum efficiency. We believe in the power of the browser native software and the potential of small form-factor hardware. By combining the accessibility of the browser with the power of modern AI and advanced mathematics, WebXOS delivers solutions that are not only innovative but also incredibly efficient and accessible to all. We turn embedded devices into powerful computing stations, delivering enterprise-grade performance at a fraction of the cost and energy consumption.


- **Front-end Architectures**: Single `.html` files encapsulate all code and assets, ensuring portability and ease of deployment.
  
- **Decentralized Designs**: Supports P2P Web3 for resilient, serverless applications ideal for edge computing.
  
- **AI-Driven Developments**: Utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate optimized, modular code via sophisticated prompts.
  
- **High Performance & Modularity**: Native JavaScript, WebGL, Three.js, and WASM enable lightweight, reusable components.

- **Eco-Friendly & PWA-Ready**: Optimized for low-end devices (≥320px screens), offline functionality, and minimal resource consumption. Raspberry Pi, Arduino, IoT Devices +more.

- **P2P Applications**: Decentralized tools for secure networking and data exchange, built for performance and scalability.

# Local Data

Instantaneous results without cloud uploads: WEBXOS offers web tools that process data for tasks like editing images, manipulating files, or analyzing data. WEBXOS's approach to client-side processing fundamentally enhances user privacy by keeping data on the user's device and not on a server. This model avoids the privacy vulnerabilities of server-side systems, where user data can be vulnerable to breaches or surveillance.
