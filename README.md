# webXOS 2025:

**webXOS** is an innovative software development company developing progressive web applications tailored for decentralized web3 environments. Leveraging native JavaScript, WebGL, Three.js, and WebAssembly (WASM), Webxos delivers lightweight, modular progressive web apps (PWAs) that prioritize performance, privacy, and sustainability. Our ecosystem, showcased at [webxos.netlify.app](https://webxos.netlify.app) and [webxos/webxos](https://github.com/webxos/webxos), encompasses eco-friendly apps, retro games, and client-side AI agents, all designed to operate seamlessly in the browser.

Each webXOS modular APP (webxos.netlify.app/tools) is a self-contained `.html` file, embedding all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets for maximum portability and modularity. We harness AI-driven tools to create advanced prompts that accelerate the development of high-performance, decentralized apps. From P2P networking tools to immersive WebGL games, webXOS empowers developers to build the future. 

*WEBXOS is pioneering frameworks and tools on a browser first philosophy, emphasizing modularity, efficiency, and environmental responsibility.*

## Why webXOS?

- **Front-end Architectures**: Single `.html` files encapsulate all code and assets, ensuring portability and ease of deployment.
- **Decentralized Designs**: Supports P2P Web3 for resilient, serverless applications ideal for edge computing.

## More info

WEBXOS's approach to client-side processing fundamentally enhances user privacy by keeping data on the user's device and not on a server. This model avoids the privacy vulnerabilities of server-side systems, where user data can be vulnerable to breaches or surveillance. 
Here are specific examples of how different WEBXOS tools and agents use client-side processing to protect privacy: 
Secure Data Storage with Exoskeleton AI

    Encrypted client-side databases: Exoskeleton AI functions as a "front-end data storage platform" that uses CSS grids and neural nodes to encode databases. The database is stored directly within the browser, and all data is encrypted.
    No central server: Since there is "zero backend server" usage for storing the data, WEBXOS, Netlify (which hosts webxos.netlify.app), or any other third party has no access to the user's private data.
    Use-case example: Private notepad: The secure, client-side database allows for applications like a personal notepad or journal where entries are securely stored on the user's device. No one else can read or access these private thoughts and notes. 

Private AI tools with Micro LMs

    Processing sensitive data locally: WEBXOS uses Micro LMs, or small learning models, that can perform AI tasks directly on the client's device. This allows sensitive user data to be processed with end-to-end encryption.
    Example: Watchdog AI: The green energy compatibility tester, Watchdog AI, can analyze personal usage data without sending it to a remote server. This allows for personalized recommendations while maintaining the privacy of the user's energy consumption habits.
    Data never leaves the device: Similar to the database, the user's data remains on their machine throughout the AI processing, ensuring that their behavioral or input data is never exposed to external servers. 

Browser-based key management

    Secure browser key storage: Tools like WEBXOS's Secure Key likely leverage Web Authentication (WebAuthn) standards, which use public-key cryptography to authenticate users. The cryptographic private key is stored securely on the user's device, not on a server.
    Passwordless authentication: This method removes the need for storing and managing passwords, which are common targets for data breaches. It prevents credential theft because the private key is never transmitted. 

Local data processing for web tools

    Instantaneous results without cloud uploads: WEBXOS offers web tools that process data for tasks like editing images, manipulating files, or analyzing data.
    Example: Image manipulation: When a user resizes or crops an image with a WEBXOS tool, the processing happens on their computer. The image file is not uploaded to a cloud server, ensuring that the original, sensitive data never leaves their control.
    Offline capabilities: The client-side approach means that some tools can function offline, which inherently means no data is being sent to a server. This design ensures that the application's functionality is resilient and private, even without an internet connection.
