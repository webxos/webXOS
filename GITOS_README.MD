- **Key Features**:
  - Telemetry monitoring with eco-aware drone metrics.
  - Tokenized wallet for IoT data marketplaces.
  - Prompt engineering for AI-driven drone behaviors.
  - Git tools for firmware versioning.
  - Backend setup for IoT gateways and drone APIs.
- **Setup**: `git clone https://github.com/webxos/webXOS.git`, customize `gitos-template.html` to `GITOS.html` with drone-specific JS, and deploy to Netlify.

This lightweight IDE supports browser-native development of PWAs for FPV drones, sensor fusion, and edge AI, using WebGL for simulations and low-power APIs for real-world efficiency.

## Basic Usage
1. **Launch**: Open in browser or deployed site.
2. **Navigate**: Scroll to modules (Telemetry Watchdog, Vial Fleet, ARCR Flight Planner, Git Swarm, IoT Bridge).
3. **Interact**: Execute commands (e.g., 'SCAN' for drone status) via console or copy-paste.
4. **Customize**: Embed drone sims (e.g., via Gazebo JS ports) and IoT protocols.

# Comprehensive Guide to Drone & IoT Workspace IDE - GITOS v1.0

## Introduction
GITOS (beta): webxos.netlify.app/gitOS, tailored for Drone & IoT development in webXOS, transforms a general IDE into a specialized workspace for small scale UI and low-end devices. Drawing from web3 principles, it enables eco-efficient coding for applications like precision agriculture and urban delivery, where drones integrate IoT sensors for real-time data flows. The arcade-inspired interface boots with aerial readiness signals, making it ideal for edge developers building PWAs that run on low-resource devices like Raspberry Pi gateways or drone onboard computers. Plus Simulations, API access, and git "prompts" right through a lightweight HTML page. All contained within the one-page-browser-first design of webXOS modular apps.

## Core Modules Breakdown

### 🛡️ WATCHDOG AI BETA: Real-Time Drone & IoT Monitoring
Watchdog dashboard, tracking device vitals and with sustainability metrics to minimize energy waste in remote operations.
webxos.netlify.app/watchdog

**Potential Use Case: Precision Agriculture Surveys**  
In farming, Watchdog monitors a drone fleet surveying crop health via multispectral IoT batteries. It detects low battery mid-flight and logs carbon savings from optimized paths—reducing potential fuel use by up to 30% in large fields.

### 🧪 $VIAL MCP FLEET WALLET: Customizable Wallet System & Tokenized Asset Management for low end devices.
Adapted for decentralized drone economies, this wallet handles $WEBXOS tokens for micropayments on data streams, like rewarding IoT nodes for shared sensor intel. Uses PyTorch and Qiskit quantum encryption to encrypt wallet data. webxos.netlify.app/vial

**Potential Use Case: Urban Delivery Networks** 
For urban logistics, the wallet automates payments: a drone delivers packages, IoT beacons confirm receipt, and tokens reward the swarm—streamlining e-commerce with blockchain-verified transactions, cutting disputes by 40%.


### 4. 🔧 COMING SOON: GIT PROMPT CONTROL UI: Version Control for Firmware & Scripts
Tailored for iterative mass sets device code using prompting techniques with git and JSON, this cheat sheet manages branches for all types of use cases like hardware driver variants.

**Potential with back-end configurations: Use Case: Digital Twin 8Bim Construction Site Mapping** 
Teams version drone scripts for 3D 8bim construction site models: connected IoT devices tracks and connect to let users push updates to code, merging IoT weather feeds—enabling accurate progress tracking and reducing survey errors by 15%. (Back-end Required)

### 5. 🔌 IOT BRIDGE & BACKEND SETUP: Gateways and IoT APIs
Focuses on bridging webXOS frameworks and modular tools (webxos.netlify.app/tools) to ROS or MQTT for IoT, with Netlify for frontend and Node for edge servers.

# EXAMPLE SETUP GUIDE (for your custom build or repo):

**Setup Steps**:
1. **Clone & Prep**:
   ```
   git clone (from https://github.com/webxos/webXOS)
   cd webXOS
   cp gitos-template.html GITOS.html  # Add drone JS
   ```
2. **Netlify Deploy**:
   - Drag ZIP to [app.netlify.com/drop]
   - Git: Set build to `echo "Deploy ready"`, dir `/`.
3. **Node.js IoT Backend Example**:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const mqtt = require('mqtt');
   const app = express();
   app.use(express.json());

   const client = mqtt.connect('mqtt://localhost:1883');
   client.on('connect', () => {
     client.subscribe('drone/telemetry');
   });

   app.post('/api/flight/launch', (req, res) => {
     client.publish('drone/control', JSON.stringify(req.body));
     res.json({ status: 'Launched' });
   });

   app.get('/api/sensors/:id', (req, res) => {
     // Fetch IoT data
     res.json({ temp: 22.5, humidity: 60 });
   });

   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('IoT Bridge on 3000'));
   ```
   Run: `node bridge.js`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Potential Use Case: Inventory Management in Warehouses**  
The bridge connects drones to IoT RFID tags: backend processes scans for stock levels, triggering auto-reorders—improving accuracy to 99% and slashing manual audits.

## More Potential Use Cases 
GITOS shines in hybrid drone-IoT scenarios:
- **Agriculture**: Autonomous crop monitoring with sensor fusion.
- **Logistics**: Swarm deliveries with tokenized payments.
- **Manufacturing**: AI inspections via LiDAR and edge alerts.
- **Construction**: Real-time 3D mapping for progress tracking.
- **Environmental**: Eco-drone patrols logging carbon data.
