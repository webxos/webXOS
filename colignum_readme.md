## COLIGNUM 2026

*UNDER DEVELOPMENT* 

## 1. BUSINESS CONCEPT:

-3D assisted design in C/Assembly languages, front-end browser-based with multi-parameter tools and AI assistant CLI.
-Helps users fine-tune 3D models and 3D printing schematics in Three.js wireframe point cloud and dot work black-and-white IDE.
-Helps users develop their own IDEs for developers.
-Makes custom UI and front-end for other businesses on private contracts.
-Uses advanced algorithms and math to create, generate, and modify 3D modeling from foundational C/Assembly level, inspiring customers and users to learn more about the foundational layer of 3D graphic design in black and white only.
-Offers a line of SDKs, IDEs, CLI terminals, and 3D editor software custom for users, human-curated for security and custom use cases, custom editors, small front-end niche projects and 3D printing projects, custom for 3D studios and 3D printers, artists and enthusiasts alike utilizing Three.js in HTML with AI-generated layers, JSON, and schematics with AutoCAD-focused options also available.
-Creates tools and ML AI that runs front-end Three.js based HTML with JSON data and PyTorch backend.
-Scalable hosting: Deploy the frontend (Three.js application) as a serverless service or in containers.

## 2. BACKEND AI & Machine Learning Integration (TensorFlow/PyTorch) coming in 2026

 Personalization: Implement machine learning models to build custom modular front-end based IDE and SDK in 3D environments and provide personalized content recommendations or experiences.

 Client-Side AI: Use libraries like TensorFlow.js to run lightweight ML models directly in the user's browser, enabling real-time interactions without constant server communication.

## 3. COLIGNUM: Operational Excellence

 AI-Driven Development: Utilize AI ML c/assembly fluent agents to assist in creative coding workflows, generating foundational Three.js code snippets or debugging JavaScript, which accelerates development on the 3d base abstraction and mathmatrical layers using lightweight but advanced design to tailor app designs, data sets, and 3d imagery for all types of users

 MLOps (Machine Learning Operations): Apply 3d json design and editor, auto-cad style MLOps principles to manage the full lifecycle of your AI models, including versioning, deployment, monitoring, and digital imaging, ensuring they remain performant and up-to-date in production.

 Platform Engineering: Establish a platform to provide internal developer platforms (IDPs) and toolchains for the 3D editing software found in the COLIGNUM platform.

# 4. Leveraging TensorFlow.js for In-Browser ML 

Running ML models in the browser with TensorFlow.js offers significant advantages for use cases like real-time UX: 

  Real-Time Interaction: By processing data directly on the client's device, you eliminate network latency and ensure instant responses, which is crucial for real-time interactions.

  Privacy and Security: Sensitive user data is processed locally and never leaves the user's device, enhancing privacy and complying with data protection regulations.

  Reduced Server Costs: Computation is offloaded to the user's hardware (leveraging WASM, WebGL for GPU acceleration), reducing your backend server load and infrastructure costs.

  Scalability and Reach: The application can host and scale automatically using a docker-like RAG system, as the processing power is distributed across all users' devices. Anyone with a compatible web browser can use the service without needing a specific app installation. 

  The compiled frontend code is typically packaged and uploaded to an object storage service used to create our tools and software in HTML front end enviroments for users and teams alike. 

  A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used to cache and serve these static assets from edge locations globally, ensuring low-latency delivery to users worldwide.

  This eliminates the need to manage servers and provides automatic scaling based on demand for rapid deployment and scaling for a variety of clients.


# 5. Coming in 2026: Back-end Server with Container Deployment for custom apps and gallery datasets:

Containers (Docker-like but custom designed proprietary for COLIGNUM) provide consistency across different environments and can be managed by orchestration platforms.

  How it works:

  The custom 3D editor software made for  Three.js applications is packaged into a Docker image, which includes everything needed to run the application (code, runtime, libraries, etc.) which enables fast deployment of models and builds for customers and users.

  This container can be deployed to container hosting services custom for each user.

  Advantages: This approach offers greater control over the environment and dependencies and simplifies development workflows by ensuring consistency between local development and production environments for COLIGNUM 3D software.
