Resolution Notes (2025-08-04)

Issue: All four agents (server-agent1 through server-agent4) returned HTTP 404 errors when accessing /api/[agent]/health.
Cause: Netlify Functions were not properly deployed or configured. The netlify.toml file lacked correct function directory and redirect rules. Agent index.js files did not define /health endpoints.
Fixes Applied:
Updated netlify.toml to set functions = "server" and added redirect rule [[redirects]] from = "/api/*" to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat" status = 200 force = true.
Created server/agent1/index.js, server/agent2/index.js, server/agent3/index.js, and server/agent4/index.js with /health endpoints using utils/agent-base.js.
Created server/utils/agent-base.js with handleHealthCheck function for consistent health check responses.
Updated server.html to fetch from /.netlify/functions/[agent]/health instead of /api/[agent]/health to align with Netlify's function routing.
Added MIME type header for sw.js in netlify.toml to fix service worker registration (Content-Type: text/javascript).


Next Steps:
Run netlify deploy --prod to deploy updated functions and configuration.
Test locally with netlify dev and verify endpoints with curl http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/server-agent1/health (repeat for agents 2â€“4).
Check Netlify Functions dashboard to confirm deployment of server-agent1 through server-agent4.
Monitor server.html for successful health checks and update this log with any new errors.
