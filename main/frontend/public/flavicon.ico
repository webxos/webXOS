# Placeholder for favicon.ico
# This file represents a favicon for the Vial MCP PWA, styled in retro green-on-black aesthetic.
# In a real implementation, generate or include an actual ICO file with a terminal-like logo (e.g., a green vial or MCP text on black background).
# For now, this is a text placeholder to fit the artifact structure.
# To create the favicon:
# - Use a graphic design tool (e.g., Figma, Photoshop) to design a 16x16 or 32x32 pixel image.
# - Incorporate green (#00ff00) and black (#000000) colors to match the theme.
# - Save as ICO format.
# - Place in main/frontend/public/favicon.ico and reference in index.html with <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico">.
