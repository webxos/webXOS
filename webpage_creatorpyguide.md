Overview
The WebXOS Webpage Creator is a Python script that generates modern, text-only HTML webpages with unique, minimal designs for 14 formats (e.g., blog, resume, essay). It runs in the Injector AI environment using Skulpt 1.2.0, with no external dependencies. Each format has tailored input fields and CSS styling, optimized for Netlify hosting.
Usage Instructions

Inject the Script:

Open the Injector AI HTML interface.
Click “Inject” to open the Python popup.
Copy and paste the webpage_creator.py script into the textarea.
Click “Inject Script” to run it.


Interact with the Menu:

The script displays a menu with a WebXOS copyright notice.
Enter commands:
begin: Start the webpage creation process.

quit: Exit the program.


Follow the steps:
Format: Choose a format (e.g., blog, resume, quote).
Format-Specific Fields: Enter fields based on the format (e.g., resume: bio, job history, skills, education). Each field has a 200-character limit, and \n creates line breaks.

Export and View:

Copy the HTML output from the Injector AI console.
Paste into a text editor and save as page.html.
Open page.html in a browser to view the webpage with WebXOS-branded footer.
For hosting, deploy to Netlify by dragging the file to your site’s “Deploys” tab or linking a GitHub repository (e.g., github.com/webxos/webxos).


Troubleshooting:

If errors occur, check the error tooltip (e.g., “No HTML tags allowed”).
Use the “Eject” button in the Injector AI console to reset, then type begin to restart.
Ensure inputs avoid <>"'\ and respect 200-char limits.
